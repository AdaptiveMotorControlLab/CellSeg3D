Introduction
===================

Welcome to napari-cellseg-annotator !
--------------------------------------------

Here you will find instructions on how to use the program.
If the installation was successful, you'll see the napari-cellseg-annotator plugin
in the Plugins section of napari.

This plugin is intended for the review of labeled cell volumes [#]_ from mice whole-brain samples
imaged by mesoSPIM microscopy [#]_ , and for training and using segmentation models from the MONAI project [#]_, or
any custom model written in Pytorch.

From here you can access the guides on the several modules available for your tasks, such as :

* Review : :ref:`loader_module_guide`
* Inference: :ref:`inference_module_guide`
* Training : :ref:`training_module_guide`
* Cropping utility (3D) : :ref:`cropping_module_guide`
