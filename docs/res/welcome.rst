Welcome to napari-cellseg-annotator !
--------------------------------------------

Here you will find instructions on how to use the program.
If the installation was successful, you'll see the napari-cellseg-annotator plugin
in the Plugins section of napari.

For now, this plugin is intended for the review of labeled cell volumes [#]_ from mice whole-brain samples
imaged by mesoSPIM microscopy. [#]_

From here you can access the several modules available, such as :

* Reviewer : :ref:`loader_module_guide`
* Predicter : WIP
