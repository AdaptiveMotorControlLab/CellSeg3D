# Testing CellSeg3D on demo data

Here is a very small volume (from [IDR project 853](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-853)) to test on.
You can install, launch `napari`, activate the CellSeg3D plugin app, and drag & drop this volume into the canvas.
Then, for example, run `inference` with one of our models.

See [CellSeg3D documentation](https://adaptivemotorcontrollab.github.io/CellSeg3D/welcome.html) for more details.
