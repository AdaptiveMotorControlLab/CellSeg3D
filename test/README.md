# Testing CellSeg3D on demo data

Here is a very small volume (from [here](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-853)) to test on. You can install (see docs), launch `napari`, activate the CellSeg3D plugin app, and drag & drop this volume into the canvas. Then, for example, run `inference` with one of our models.
